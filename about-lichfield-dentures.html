<h1>About the Lichfield Denture Clinic</h1>

<p>At <strong>Lichfield Denture Clinic</strong> we aim to provide you with &ldquo;<strong>Natural Looking Dentures</strong>&rdquo; which will give you as natural an appearance as possible, whether we are providing dentures to replace all your natural teeth or just some of them, getting them to blend in seamlessly, our overall aim is to provide you with dentures that won&rsquo;t look like dentures.</p>
<p>Most treatment will be conducted by a Clinical Dental Technician (CDT), CDT&rsquo;s are a relatively new addition to the dental team.<br />
  &ldquo;Clinical Dental Technicians are registered dental professionals who provide complete dentures direct to the patients and other dental devices on prescription from a dentist. They are also qualified dental technicians. Patients with natural teeth or implants must see a dentist before the CDT can begin treatment. CDT&rsquo;s refer patients to a dentist if they need a treatment plan or if the CDT is concerned about the patient&rsquo;s oral health&rdquo; the General Dental Council</p>

<h2>Natural looking dentures</h2>
<p>While we provide new dentures of high quality we also provide other denture services, some are done in house by ourselves, such as denture relining to help if your dentures are loose and denture cleaning to remove any build up of stains; while other services require the involvement of a dentist, such as, denture stabilisation, this is the use of dental implants which act as anchors, the denture fits over them and is held in place with the help of magnets or clips, not every patient is suitable for dental implants or will want them, however they are very successful and could be the answer to your loose denture problem, please look on the other pages for more details. </p>
<h3>In addition to denture services...</h3>
<p>In addition to denture services we also provide other services, including Mandibular Advancement Devices (also known as Anti-Snoring appliances or Sleep Apnoea appliances), Sports Mouth guards and Gum shields and Occlusal appliances. If the service you require requires the involvement of a dentist this will be arranged.</p>
